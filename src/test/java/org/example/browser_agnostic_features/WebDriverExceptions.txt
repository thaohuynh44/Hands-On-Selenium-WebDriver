- All exceptions provided by WebDriver API inherit from the class WebDriverExpcetion class and are 'unchecked'
Object
    Throwable
        Exception
            WebDriverException
                DevToolsException
                ...

- The root of this hierarchy is the Throwable class, it has 2 subclasses:
    Error: irrecoverable problems, applications crash rather than handle these errors (i.e. OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError)
    Exception: recoverable problems, can handle these exceptions by using try-catch blocks, there're 2 types of Exception classes:
        Checked exception:  directly inherit the Throwable class, validated at compile time, must handle in try-catch block or rethrow using throws keyword (i.e. IOException or MalformedURLException)
        Unchecked exception: inherit from RuntimeException, subtype of Exception, not required being handled with try-catch or rethrowing with throws
